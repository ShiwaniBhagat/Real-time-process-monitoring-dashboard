This project collects real-time system performance data, so it doesn't require a static data file. However, if you want to test the dashboard without live monitoring, you can use a sample CSV file.
The sample file contains:

CPU Usage (%) – Simulated CPU usage over time.

Memory Usage (%) – Random memory usage values.

Disk Usage (%) – Simulated disk usage data.

Running Processes – Sample process details like PID, name, CPU %, and memory %.
We attached two sample data files in this repository.
